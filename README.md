A fork of [klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) that always rounds the shadows and outlines of windows, regardless of whether or not they have any borders, for use with [LightlyShaders 2.0](https://github.com/a-parhom/LightlyShaders/tree/v2.0).

(UPDATE): Useless now due to a LightlyShaders update, which no longer supports window decorations with outlines. Probably still works on v2.0, but v2.0 doesn't work with the latest version of Plasma.
